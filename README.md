Technical Test For Software Engineer Position.
The test was centered around creating API end points for stocks.
The endpoints are documented using OpenAPI.
The documentation can be accessed on "http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html".
The solution was designed and implemented with a lot of detail being paid towards following solid principles and OOP principles.
H2 in memory database was used for the solution.
To start the application open command line and from the root of the project run "mvn spring-boot:run"
To access the in memory database open your broswer and open "http://localhost:8080/h2-console"
Use postman collection in the project as a blue print for how to use the endpoints.
